AGL Developer Test
===
Thank you for providing me with this test.

I suppose that the JSON resouse is hosted under same domain. So I included the JSON file in this repo.

Demo at: http://ademo.info/agl-code-test

V2
===
V2 is written from an architecture's perspective. It also facilitates writing unit tests.  It has following structure:

UI module
ui.js - responsible for building UI, rendering HTML markups, etc.

Model module
model.js - handle and organize data. Provide data utilities, etc.

AJAX module
ajax.js - make ajax calls. Handle response headers, remote errors, etc.

Main module
main.js - make everything together.

---
The final result is same as the one first built, but tests are included.
